                        <p>The following are the <b>three main steps</b> that will be followed during the whole Voting Process:</p>

                        <li><a href="#vote" style="color: darkblue;"><b><h3>VOTE</h3></b></a></li>

                            <a href="#regipro" style="color: darkblue;"><b>[skip to the Registration Process]</b></a></li>
                            <p>This is the first step of the voting process where the voters and the candidates have to register themselves in order to cast a vote on the voting day.<br><br>
                                <b>In case of <u>voters</u>, the registration will be final and the data entered during the registration cannot be changed later.</b><br><br>
                                <b>In case of <u>candidates</u>, the registration will be provisional and the internal comittee will later verify the data and nominate the candidate.</b><br>
                                <div style="color: red;"><b>NOTE- </b>Candidates who have already registered can check their nomination status by clicking the <b><i>'Check Candidate Status'</i></b> tab.<br><br>
                                A candidate must also register as a voter to cast the vote. A candidate account will NOT allow the candidate to vote.<br><br></div>
                                Registration must be completed before the registration period ends.<br>
                                Once the registration period ends, the internal comitte will analyse the data and nominate the candidates for the vote to take place. <br><br>
                                The data entered during the registration must be correct and up to date, failing to which may lead to cancellation of the registration of the voter or the candidate. <br> <br>
                                <div style="color: red;"><b>Once a registration of a voter is cancelled, the person will not be allowed to vote on the voting day and request of re-registration will not be entertained.<br><br>
                                Once a registration of a candidate is cancelled, the person will be denominated and request of re-nomination will not be entertained.</b></div><br>
                                Voters and candidates are requested to register much before the last date to avoid the last minute rush. <br><br>

                            <p>At the second step of the voting system, voters are required to log-in and cast votes to their preferred nominated candidates on the day of vote.<br><br>
                                The registered mobile number, along with the password given during the registration is required to log-in into the account. <br>
                                <div style="color: red;"><b>NOTE- </b>There is no provision of changing the password once a voter is registered. So, it is important to <b>remember the password</b> given during the registration, else voter will not be able to vote.<br><br></div>
                                On the left hand side of the page, the details of the voter will be shown and on the other side, the details of the candidate will be shown.<br><br>
                                To cast the vote, the <b><i>'Vote'</i></b> button beside the voter's favourite nominee should be clicked. <br><br>
                                <div style="color: red;"><b>Vote can be cast ONLY ONCE. So voting must be performed with caution. <br><br> The security of the vote is only the concern of the voter. The place of voting must be chosen wisely.</b><br></div><br>
                                Once the vote is given, there is no need to login again and the current result of the vote can be viewed from the <i>'View Vote Status'</i> page. <br><br>

                            <p>This is the last step of the voting process where the status of the votes (when the vote is ongoing) or the winner (once the vote is over) is shown. <br><br>
                                This is a public page and it is visible to anyone with the link (for security reasons). So it is not mandatory to login to view this page. <br><br>
                                On the left hand side of the page:

                                    <li>The list of all the nominated candidates along with their group name and the number of votes can be seen, <b>when the vote is ongoing.</b></li><br>
                                    <li>The details of the winning candidate is shown, <b>when the vote has ended.</b></li>
                                <br></ul>
                                On the right hand side of the page, a visual illustration of how much votes a candidate got (along with the percentage) is shown for easy recognition of the leading or lagging groups. <br><br>
                                The header also shows the difference betweeen the leading and the second leading candidate. <br><br>
